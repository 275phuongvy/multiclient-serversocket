# Transmitting arrays of strings between multi Clients and Server by using TCP Socket Programming in C

Author: Vy P Tran

General purpose: Multiple clients try to send multiple arrays of strings (including characters and special symbols) to server so that the server can sort the array of strings by using mergesort algorithm and then send back the sorted arrays to clients. Specially, server has to handle the concurrent requests from multiple clients at the same time by using fork()
